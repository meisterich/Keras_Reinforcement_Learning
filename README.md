# Keras_Reinforcement_Learning
This is a collection of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms based on Keras and Tensorflow 2
Algorithms are seperated for discrete and continuous action spaces.

Discrete:
- DDQN based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461
- REINFORCE
- PPO based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347

Continuous:
- NAF based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00748
- REINFORCE
- PPO
